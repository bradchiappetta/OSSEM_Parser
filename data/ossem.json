URLs targeting the API are constructed in the following pattern /api.php?action=ask&format=<format specifier>&query=<insert query statement> where <format specifier> is a specific output format (usually json or jsonfm) and <insert query statement> refers to a query that specifies the data that will be retrieved. Queries are structured as if they are targeting the Semantic MediaWiki #ask parser function. Queries are constructed by combining one or more page selectors with a set of display parameters. A simple selector for all techniques is [[Category:Technique]] and a simple display parameter is ?Has display name which maps to the name of the ATT&CK Technique. To construct the query, the selector is combined with the display parameter by placing a | symbol in between. So the combined query is [[Category:Technique]]|?Has display name. This query will retrieve all ATT&CK techniques along with their display name. To run this we just have to URL encode the combined query and place it in the URL. The final query is: https://attack.mitre.org/api.php?action=ask&format=jsonfm&query=%5B%5BCategory%3ATechnique%5D%5D%7C%3FHas%20display%20name .PARAMETER Sync Connects to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and dumps all its data to an object.
