                by the PowerShell engine, thereby capturing the full contents of code
                executed by an attacker, including scripts and commands. Due to the
                nature of script block logging, it also records de-obfuscated code
                as it is executed. For example, in addition to recording the original
                obfuscated code, script block logging records the decoded commands
                passed with PowerShell''s -EncodedCommand argument, as well as those
                obfuscated with XOR, Base64, ROT13, encryption, etc., in addition
                to the original obfuscated code. Script block logging will not record
                output from the executed code. '

                \ this script to interact with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework via its\
                \ API and gather information about techniques, tactics, groups, software\
                \ and references provided by the MITRE ATT&CK Team @MITREattack Almost\
                \ all data in ATT&CK can be accessed using the Semantic MediaWiki\
                \ Ask API. URLs targeting the API are constructed in the following\
                \ pattern /api.php?action=ask&format=<format specifier>&query=<insert\
                \ query statement> where <format specifier> is a specific output format\
                \ (usually json or jsonfm) and <insert query statement> refers to\
                \ a query that specifies the data that will be retrieved. Queries\
                \ are structured as if they are targeting the Semantic MediaWiki #ask\
                \ parser function. Queries are constructed by combining one or more\
                \ page selectors with a set of display parameters. A simple selector\
                \ for all techniques is [[Category:Technique]] and a simple display\
                \ parameter is ?Has display name which maps to the name of the ATT&CK\
                \ Technique. To construct the query, the selector is combined with\
                \ the display parameter by placing a | symbol in between. So the combined\
                \ query is [[Category:Technique]]|?Has display name. This query will\
                \ retrieve all ATT&CK techniques along with their display name. To\
                \ run this we just have to URL encode the combined query and place\
                \ it in the URL. The final query is: https://attack.mitre.org/api.php?action=ask&format=jsonfm&query=%5B%5BCategory%3ATechnique%5D%5D%7C%3FHas%20display%20name\
                \ .PARAMETER Sync Connects to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and dumps\
                \ all its data to an object. The output of this is needed before running\
                \ any other parameters. .PARAMETER Matrix Switch that you can use\

            text: The process accessed event reports when a process opens another
              process, an operation that's often followed by information queries or
              reading and writing the address space of the target process. This enables
              detection of hacking tools that read the memory contents of processes
              like Local Security Authority (Lsass.exe) in order to steal credentials
              for use in Pass-the-Hash attacks. Enabling it can generate significant
              amounts of logging if there are diagnostic utilities active that repeatedly
              open processes to query their state, so it generally should only be
              done so with filters that remove expected accesses.

            text: The image loaded event logs when a module is loaded in a specific
              process. This event is disabled by default and needs to be configured
              with the -l option. It indicates the process in which the module is
              loaded, hashes and signature information. The signature is created asynchronously
              for performance reasons and indicates if the file was removed after
              loading. This event should be configured carefully, as monitoring all
              image load events will generate a large number of events.
